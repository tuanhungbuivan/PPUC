Okay, I know you have competing priorities and that your organization has grown and that
maybe this isn't the most important thing on your agenda any more...

The thing is, your competition might actually act like the thing that they're doing is their only
job. They might believe that in fact, treating this customer as if she's the only person in the
world is worth it. That fixing that squeaky door, addressing that two-year old bug in the
software, or taking one extra moment to look someone in the eye and talking to her with
respect is worth it.

We don't become mediocre all at once, and we rarely do it on purpose. Instead, we start
believing that the entire project is our job, not this one thing, this one thing we used to do so
brilliantly.

The day the organization installs the, "your call is very important to us..." message is the day
that they announce to themselves who they are becoming. Customers rarely care about your
priorities.

Getting bigger is supposed to make us more effective and efficient. Alas, the way to get there
isn't by doing what you used to do, but less well.
